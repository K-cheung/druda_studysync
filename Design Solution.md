## Problem:

Students have trouble fully understanding their concepts without an interactive approach to studying. This encourages students to just memorize practice questions and answers without understanding the underlying concepts. This takes away from students' learning and hinders their academic performance. 

## Solution:

We want to create an application that allows for students to have a more interactive approach to studying. When they open the application, they will be brought to the “Homepage” where the current courses they are studying for will be displayed. 

![Start up page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b240ef-685d-4c04-b5d7-21415329501d)

![Home page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/192236e3-c569-4a72-aaf2-2ad97c6a6cb8)

Each course on the homepage when pressed will lead to the “[Subject] Course Page”. There will be a plus sign on the “Homepage” that will take them to the “Add Courses Page”. 

![Add course page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1907574c-aa43-488d-935c-c111148605cc)


The “[Subject] Course Page” where there will be a list of the course modules and topics/concepts. Users will be able to select which topics or modules they want to be tested on.  

![Course topic page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/214eb108-d894-4174-904e-3f593a9d0d5c)

There will also be a button labeled “Request Questions” that they can press that will lead them to the “Contact Us”.

Once they have made their choice on what to be tested on, the app will then bring them to the “Question Page”. The “Question Page” will display a multiple-choice question. Users can select their answer to the question. 

![Question page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e2014ef-771c-4fdb-9191-cd607447fa42)

After doing so, the correct answer will be displayed along with an explanation for the answer. 

![Correct answer page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b3405a6-f5fb-46f4-894a-139cdef91969)

![Wrong answer page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1cb9270-d4d2-4e93-9735-c30d885183d4)

There will be a button allowing users to get another question. After they have answered all the available questions, the app will display a message like “Well done! You have answered all the questions” and they will have the option to restart and be asked the questions again. 

![Well done!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97097063-9674-4e2d-b7c3-268a833d8eba)

On the question page, there will also be a history button where users are able to see the previous questions they have answered and whether they answered it correctly or not. 

The “Add Courses Page” has a list of available courses where they can select available courses from the list to add to their set of courses. At the bottom of the page, there will be a request course button that will lead them to the “Contact Us”. 

![Add course page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fd66ed0-b542-44eb-abf7-62f866a05c70)

The “Contact Us” is where users can send a request for a certain course to be added or for more questions to be added for a specific course. 

On each page, they will also have the option to go back to the previous page or to the homepage.
