Team name: Druda-StudySync

Mission Statement: Asking questions to help students effectively study and reinforce their understanding.

Team members: Jimmy Chen, Kayli Cheung, Kathryne Zong, Jerry Huang, Yuta Covington

Problem Statement:

Students often struggle to retain the information that they learn in class, leading them to struggle when preparing for exams. Without an interactive approach to studying, students can often resort to memorizing questions and answers without fully understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of understanding affects students' academic performance and ability to apply the concepts theyâ€™ve learned to other questions outside of the practice they are given. Therefore, how can we provide students with tools to help them study effectively and truly understand their coursework?
